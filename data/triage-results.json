      "body": "### Steps to reproduce\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\n1. Render a `<RichTreeViewPro />` with a `dataSource` prop for lazy loading\n2. Pass any prop as an inline object, function, or array (e.g. `dataSource={{ ... }}`, `isItemDisabled={item => ...}`, `selectedItems={Array.from(...)}`, `selectionPropagation={{ descendants: true, parents: false }}`)\n3. Click to expand a folder that triggers lazy loading via `getTreeItems`\n\nA minimal reproduction would be:\n\n```tsx\n<RichTreeViewPro\n  items={rootItems}\n  dataSource={{\n    getChildrenCount: item => item.childrenCount ?? 0,\n    getTreeItems: async (parentId) => {\n      // simulate network delay\n      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000));\n      return fetchChildren(parentId);\n    },\n  }}\n  selectedItems={someArray}\n  selectionPropagation={{ descendants: true, parents: false }}\n  isItemDisabled={item => item.type === 'file'}\n  onSelectedItemsChange={(_, ids) => setSelected(ids)}\n  slots={{ item: CustomTreeItem }}\n/>\n```\n\n### Current behavior\n\n**Current behavior**\n\nThe loading spinner (CircularProgress in the icon container) either never appears or flashes for a single frame and vanishes immediately, even though the `getTreeItems` fetch takes multiple seconds.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nThe loading spinner should remain visible for the entire duration of the `getTreeItems` async call, as it did in `@mui/x-tree-view-pro@8.8.0`.\n\n### Context\n\n**Context**\n\nThe root cause is in `RichTreeViewProStore.utils.js`. The `deriveStateFromParameters` function unconditionally resets `lazyLoadedItems` to `TREE_VIEW_LAZY_LOADED_ITEMS_INITIAL_STATE` (`{ loading: {}, errors: {} }`) on every call.\n\nThis is called from `updateStateFromParameters`, which runs inside a `useIsoLayoutEffect` whenever the `parameters` memo changes. Since `parameters` depends on every prop passed to `RichTreeViewPro`, any prop that is not referentially stable causes `parameters` to be a new reference on every render.\n\nWhen the lazy loading plugin calls `setItemLoading(itemId, true)`, the store state changes, which can trigger a re-render, which triggers `updateStateFromParameters`, which calls `deriveStateFromParameters`, which wipes `lazyLoadedItems.loading` back to `{}` — removing the loading spinner before the user ever sees it.\n\nThe `lazyLoadedItems` state is managed entirely by `TreeViewLazyLoadingPlugin` and should **not** be re-derived from parameters. The fix would be to either:\n- Remove `lazyLoadedItems` from `deriveStateFromParameters` and only set it in `getInitialState`\n- Or preserve the existing `lazyLoadedItems` value during `updateStateFromParameters`\n\n**Workaround:** Memoize every prop passed to `RichTreeViewPro`.\n\n### Your environment\n\n_No response_\n\n**Search keywords**: tree view loading\n\n**Order ID**: 116348",

So group row is present, expand it, and it shunts down to underneath the children. This may only make sense for grids with only 1 level deep.\n\nIn many financial applications you want the aggregate data for each group to be underneath. A group quite commonly may only contain 2 child rows, so something at the top or bottom of grid doesn't really work. It needs to be part of the group itself.\n\n**Search keywords**: group grid\n\n**Order ID**: 45466",
