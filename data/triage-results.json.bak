        "painPoints": "DataGrid uses its own inline <style> tags (via GridCSSVariablesContext) that accept a `nonce` prop, but this nonce is NOT automatically inherited from Emotion's CacheProvider. Users must pass `nonce` prop directly to DataGrid, which is undiscoverable.",
        "conclusion": "The DataGrid's CSS variables injection (utils/css/context.tsx) uses `rootProps.nonce` for its inline <style> tags, but does not read the nonce from Emotion's cache context. This means setting up CacheProvider with a nonce (standard Emotion CSP approach) doesn't propagate to DataGrid's own styles.",
        "reasoning": "Emotion's CacheProvider stores nonce in its cache object. The DataGrid should ideally read from that cache (via `@emotion/react`'s `useEmotionCache` or similar) as a fallback when the `nonce` prop isn't explicitly provided. The workaround (passing `nonce` directly) works but breaks the expected Emotion integration pattern.",
        "suggestedFix": "In `packages/x-data-grid/src/utils/css/context.tsx`, fall back to reading the nonce from the Emotion cache context when `rootProps.nonce` is not provided. Import `__unsafe_useEmotionCache` or equivalent from `@emotion/react` and use `cache.nonce` as fallback.",

You're right \u2014 the DataGrid's inline `<style>` tags (used for CSS variables) don't automatically pick up the nonce from Emotion's `CacheProvider`. The `nonce` prop on DataGrid is a workaround, but we should ideally read it from the Emotion cache context as a fallback. We'll look into inheriting the nonce automatically. For now, passing `<DataGrid nonce=\"...\" />` is the recommended workaround."
