This is a confirmed bug in how server-side row grouping handles re-fetched data after sort changes.\n\n**Root cause:** When `keepChildrenExpanded` is active (default for grouped data), `handleGroupedDataUpdate` uses `updateRows()` which preserves the existing tree node order instead of respecting the new server-returned order. The flat data path correctly uses `setRows()` which does reorder.\n\n**Workaround:** You can try setting `keepChildrenExpanded: false` on the data source to force the `setRows` path, though this will collapse expanded groups on sort.\n\nWe'll work on a fix to properly handle row reordering in the grouped data update path.",

        "painPoints": "When keepChildrenExpanded is true (default for grouped data re-fetches), handleGroupedDataUpdate uses apiRef.current.updateRows() which performs insert/modify/delete operations. The tree preserves the original insertion order of children \u2014 updateRows modifies existing rows in-place without reordering them. The cache also stores responses keyed by params, but sorting order changes may hit stale cache entries.",
        "conclusion": "Bug confirmed. The root cause is in handleGroupedDataUpdate (useGridDataSourceBasePro.ts ~L342). When rows are re-fetched after a sort change, updateRows() preserves existing tree node order rather than respecting the new server-returned order. Additionally, the data source cache may serve stale pre-sort responses. The fix needs to either: (1) delete and re-insert rows to establish new order, or (2) clear cache on sort model change and use setRows path for grouped data.",
        "reasoning": "Server-side sorting means the server controls row order. When sortModel changes, fetchRows is called correctly, but the response handling in handleGroupedDataUpdate with keepChildrenExpanded=true calls updateRows which does not reorder existing nodes. The flat strategy (handleFlatDataUpdate) uses setRows which does respect order. The grouped strategy should do the same when sort changes.",
        "suggestedFix": "In handleGroupedDataUpdate, detect when the fetch was triggered by a sortModelChange (could pass a flag through fetchParams). When sorting changed, use the setRows path (keepChildrenExpanded=false behavior) instead of updateRows, or implement a reorder step after updateRows. Also ensure cache.clear() is called on sortModelChange for grouped data strategies.",

This is a confirmed v8 regression.\n\n**Root cause:** `useGridApiRef()` in v8 returns a ref typed as `RefObject<GridApiCommunity | null>` (initialized to `null`), but `useGridSelector` and built-in selectors assume `apiRef.current` is non-null. When a custom component using selectors renders before the grid initializes, it crashes.\n\n**Workaround:** Guard your selector usage:\n```tsx\nconst count = apiRef.current ? gridFilteredTopLevelRowCountSelector(apiRef) : 0;\n```\n\nWe'll fix `useGridSelector` to handle the null case gracefully.",

But useGridSelector assumes apiRef.current is non-null \u2014 it calls apiRef.current.store.subscribe() and selector(apiRef) without null checks. When useGridSelector is called before the grid mounts (e.g., in a custom footer that renders before the grid initializes), it crashes with \"Cannot read properties of null\".",

The v8 migration changed useGridApiRef to explicitly type the ref as nullable (RefObject<GridApiCommunity | null>), but useGridSelector and the built-in selectors were not updated to handle the null case. The selectors directly access apiRef.current.state which throws when current is null.",
        "reasoning": "This is a type/runtime mismatch introduced in v8. The ref is correctly typed as nullable but consumers (useGridSelector, individual selectors like gridFilteredTopLevelRowCountSelector) assume non-null. The fix needs both: (1) useGridSelector should handle null apiRef.current gracefully (return a default/initial value), and (2) selector type signatures should accept nullable apiRef.",
        "suggestedFix": "In useGridSelector, add an early return with a default value when apiRef.current is null (before accessing .store or .state). For the subscribe callback, skip subscription when apiRef.current is null and re-subscribe when it becomes non-null. Update selector type signatures to accept RefObject<Api | null>. Consider adding a useSyncExternalStore getServerSnapshot that returns null/default for SSR safety too.",

This is a confirmed bug.\n\n**Root cause:** When the sort model changes with server-side tree data, only root-level rows are re-fetched. Expanded child groups retain their cached (pre-sort) order because `sortModelChange` doesn't trigger re-fetching of nested/child rows. When rows < pageSize, this is more visible because the entire dataset fits in one cache chunk.\n\n**Workaround:** After changing the sort model, manually collapse and re-expand groups to trigger child re-fetching. Or set `dataSourceCache={null}` to disable caching (though this increases server calls).\n\nWe'll fix this to re-fetch all expanded groups when the sort model changes.",

The sort model change triggers debouncedFetchRows for the root level, but for tree data with nested rows, the child rows are fetched separately via fetchRowChildren.

        "conclusion": "Bug confirmed. The issue is in the interaction between CacheChunkManager and the sort model. When rows < pageSize, the cache chunk spans the entire dataset in one chunk. On sortModelChange, the base data source hook calls debouncedFetchRows which re-fetches root rows. However, for server-side tree data, the sortModelChange event only triggers a root-level fetch \u2014 child rows are not automatically re-fetched. Combined with cache not being invalidated for sort changes on nested data, the tree retains old order.",
        "reasoning": "The sortModelChange handler in the base hook fires debouncedFetchRows() for standard strategies, but for tree data the nested rows (children) are managed separately. The cache stores responses keyed by (groupKeys + sortModel + pagination), so sort changes should produce new cache keys. The real issue is that only root-level rows are re-fetched on sort change \u2014 expanded children are not re-fetched, and their cached order persists.",
        "suggestedFix": "On sortModelChange for server-side tree data: (1) Clear the data source cache to invalidate stale sorted responses, (2) Re-fetch all currently expanded groups (not just root), similar to how filterModelChange should work. In useGridDataSourceBasePro, the sortModelChange event handler should trigger nestedDataManager.queue() for all expanded groups in addition to the root fetch.",
