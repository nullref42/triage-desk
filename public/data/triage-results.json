Enter a value.\n3. Click outside the grid to exit edit mode.\n4. The cell border is expected to shrink back to the normal non-editing size.\n5. However, in version 6.20.4, the border occasionally remains expanded as if still in edit mode.\n6. Repeat several times. The issue occurs intermittently (approximately 1 out of 10 times).\n\n### Current behavior\n\nAfter leaving edit mode, the cell border sometimes does not return to its normal size and remains in the \"editing\" visual state. This happens intermittently (around 10% of the time).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen exiting edit mode, the cell border should always shrink back to the normal size. \nThis behavior worked correctly in version 6.7.0.\n\n### Context\n\nThe issue started after upgrading:\n- \"@mui/x-data-grid\": \"^6.7.0\"  \u2192 \"^6.20.4\"\n- \"@mui/x-data-grid-pro\": \"^6.7.0\" \u2192 \"^6.20.4\"\n\nImpact: UI display issue only; data registration is not affected.\nPossibly related to grids with row-addition enabled (not fully confirmed).\n\nSupport key (Order ID): 118470\nSubmitted by Tegara Corp. on behalf of our customer in Japan.\n\n### Your environment\n\nMUI X DataGrid Pro version affected: 6.20.4\nPreviously working version: 6.7.0\n\n\n**Search keywords**: datagrid, datagrid pro, edit mode, cell border, border not shrinking, layout issue, intermittent, regression, v6.20.4, v6.7.0\n\n**Order ID**: 118470",

Pass any prop as an inline object, function, or array (e.g. `dataSource={{ ... }}`, `isItemDisabled={item => ...}`, `selectedItems={Array.from(...)}`, `selectionPropagation={{ descendants: true, parents: false }}`)\n3. Click to expand a folder that triggers lazy loading via `getTreeItems`\n\nA minimal reproduction would be:\n\n```tsx\n<RichTreeViewPro\n  items={rootItems}\n  dataSource={{\n    getChildrenCount: item => item.childrenCount ?? 0,\n    getTreeItems: async (parentId) => {\n      // simulate network delay\n      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000));\n      return fetchChildren(parentId);\n    },\n  }}\n  selectedItems={someArray}\n  selectionPropagation={{ descendants: true, parents: false }}\n  isItemDisabled={item => item.type === 'file'}\n  onSelectedItemsChange={(_, ids) => setSelected(ids)}\n  slots={{ item: CustomTreeItem }}\n/>\n```\n\n### Current behavior\n\n**Current behavior**\n\nThe loading spinner (CircularProgress in the icon container) either never appears or flashes for a single frame and vanishes immediately, even though the `getTreeItems` fetch takes multiple seconds.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nThe loading spinner should remain visible for the entire duration of the `getTreeItems` async call, as it did in `@mui/x-tree-view-pro@8.8.0`.\n\n### Context\n\n**Context**\n\nThe root cause is in `RichTreeViewProStore.utils.js`. The `deriveStateFromParameters` function unconditionally resets `lazyLoadedItems` to `TREE_VIEW_LAZY_LOADED_ITEMS_INITIAL_STATE` (`{ loading: {}, errors: {} }`) on every call:\n\n```js\nconst deriveStateFromParameters = parameters => ({\n  lazyLoadedItems: parameters.dataSource ? TREE_VIEW_LAZY_LOADED_ITEMS_INITIAL_STATE : null,\n  currentReorder: null,\n  isItemReorderable: /* ... */\n});\n```\n\nThis is called from `updateStateFromParameters`, which runs inside a `useIsoLayoutEffect` whenever the `parameters` memo (from `useExtractRichTreeViewProParameters`) changes. Since `parameters` depends on every prop passed to `RichTreeViewPro`, any prop that is not referentially stable (inline objects, inline functions, `Array.from(...)`, etc.) causes `parameters` to be a new reference on every render.\n\nWhen the lazy loading plugin calls `setItemLoading(itemId, true)`, the store state changes, which can trigger a re-render, which triggers `updateStateFromParameters`, which calls `deriveStateFromParameters`, which wipes `lazyLoadedItems.loading` back to `{}` \u2014 removing the loading spinner before the user ever sees it.\n\nThe `lazyLoadedItems` state is managed entirely by `TreeViewLazyLoadingPlugin` and should **not** be re-derived from parameters. The fix would be to either:\n- Remove `lazyLoadedItems` from `deriveStateFromParameters` and only set it in `getInitialState`\n- Or preserve the existing `lazyLoadedItems` value during `updateStateFromParameters`\n\n**Workaround:** Memoize every prop passed to `RichTreeViewPro` (`useMemo`, `useCallback`, or module-level constants) so the `parameters` memo stays referentially stable across renders.\n\n### Your environment\n\n_No response_\n\n\n**Search keywords**: tree view loading\n\n**Order ID**: 116348",

Each layer is again a full DataGrid with lots of columns.\nThe default behaviour is, that each detail DataGrid has its own horizontal scrollbar. This is really annoying if you expand multiple details and their details. You could end up with different scroll positions on the details.\n\nOur requirement is the following:\n- no detail has a scrollbar (no horizontal and no vertical)\n- master grid has a horizontal scrollbar\n- when expanding a detail that is wider then the current columns of the master grid, the horizontal scrollbar needs to appear\n- when a detail is expanded, the horizontal scrollbar of the master grid considers the width of its widest expanded detail \n\nDefault behaviour: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/agitated-goodall-ymgrr6\n\nI managed to hide all scrollbars of the details, but how can I make the scrollbar of the master grid consider its widest detail?\n\nMy current state: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/4mx3xq\n\n### Your environment\n\n<details>\n  <summary>`npx @mui/envinfo`</summary>\n\n```\n  Don't forget to mention which browser you used: I use chrome\n  Output from `npx @mui/envinfo` goes here.\n\nSystem:\n    OS: Windows 11 10.0.26100\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 24.11.1 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\n    npm: 11.6.2 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\n    pnpm: Not Found\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 145.0.7632.76\n    Edge: Chromium (145.0.3800.58)\n    Firefox: 147.0.2 - C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe\n  npmPackages:\n    @emotion/react: ^11.14.0 => 11.14.0\n    @emotion/styled: ^11.14.1 => 11.14.1\n    @mui/core-downloads-tracker:  7.3.8\n    @mui/icons-material: ^7.3.8 => 7.3.8\n    @mui/material: ^7.3.8 => 7.3.8\n    @mui/private-theming:  7.3.8\n    @mui/styled-engine:  7.3.8\n    @mui/system:  7.3.8\n    @mui/types:  7.4.11\n    @mui/utils:  7.3.8\n    @mui/x-data-grid:  8.27.1\n    @mui/x-data-grid-generator: 8.27.2 => 8.27.2\n    @mui/x-data-grid-premium: 8.27.2 => 8.27.2\n    @mui/x-data-grid-pro:  8.27.2\n    @mui/x-internal-exceljs-fork:  4.4.3\n    @mui/x-internals:  8.26.0\n    @mui/x-license:  8.26.0\n    @mui/x-telemetry:  8.20.0\n    @mui/x-virtualizer:  0.3.3\n    @types/react: ^19.2.7 => 19.2.14\n    react: 19.2.0 => 19.2.0\n    react-dom: 19.2.0 => 19.2.0\n    typescript: ^5.9.3 => 5.9.3\n```\n</details>\n\n\n**Search keywords**: datagrid master-detail scrollbars\n\n**Order ID**: 112488",

So group row is present, expand it, and it shunts down to underneath the children. This may only make sense for grids with only 1 level deep. \n\nIn many financial applications you want the aggregate data for each group to be underneath. A group quite commonly may only contain 2 child rows, so something at the top or bottom of grid doesn't really work. It needs to be part of the group itself. I don't think this is currently possible, but would it be difficult to implement?\n\n\n### Examples\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation\n\n_No response_\n\n\n**Search keywords**: group grid\n\n**Order ID**: 45466",

E.g. in the following example, clicking on `Switzerland` would return the following sub-tree.\n\n```json\n[{\n  \"id\": \"canton-zh\",\n  \"label\": \"Canton of Zurich\",\n  \"children\": [{\n    \"id\": \"city-zh\",\n    \"label\": \"Z\u00fcrich\",\n    \"children\": [{\n      \"id\": \"office-zh\",\n      \"label\": \"Office Zurich\"\n    }]\n  }]\n}]\n```\n\nI don't find a way to automatically open all sub-items.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIf the sub-tree is nested and only contains a couple of items or sub-items, we don't want the users to have to click their way to the items.\n\n## What I tired\n\n1. I tried it just doing nothing, and hoping for the best.\n2. I tried hacking my way there by making the `expandedItems` controlled.\n3.

Issue: When you select one child in a group that has multiple children, the parent\u2019s checkbox state becomes indeterminate.
