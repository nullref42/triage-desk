Enter a value.\n3. Click outside the grid to exit edit mode.\n4. The cell border is expected to shrink back to the normal non-editing size.\n5. However, in version 6.20.4, the border occasionally remains expanded as if still in edit mode.\n6. Repeat several times. The issue occurs intermittently (approximately 1 out of 10 times).\n\n### Current behavior\n\nAfter leaving edit mode, the cell border sometimes does not return to its normal size and remains in the \"editing\" visual state. This happens intermittently (around 10% of the time).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen exiting edit mode, the cell border should always shrink back to the normal size. \nThis behavior worked correctly in version 6.7.0.\n\n### Context\n\nThe issue started after upgrading:\n- \"@mui/x-data-grid\": \"^6.7.0\"  \u2192 \"^6.20.4\"\n- \"@mui/x-data-grid-pro\": \"^6.7.0\" \u2192 \"^6.20.4\"\n\nImpact: UI display issue only; data registration is not affected.\nPossibly related to grids with row-addition enabled (not fully confirmed).\n\nSupport key (Order ID): 118470\nSubmitted by Tegara Corp. on behalf of our customer in Japan.\n\n### Your environment\n\nMUI X DataGrid Pro version affected: 6.20.4\nPreviously working version: 6.7.0\n\n\n**Search keywords**: datagrid, datagrid pro, edit mode, cell border, border not shrinking, layout issue, intermittent, regression, v6.20.4, v6.7.0\n\n**Order ID**: 118470",

Without it, the operation fails silently. For your empty file system use case, please provide a `setTreeDataPath` callback that updates the row's tree data path. We should also improve the error handling to either (a) not show the drop indicator when `setTreeDataPath` is missing, or (b) surface the error clearly. Could you confirm if you're providing the `setTreeDataPath` prop?"

        "suggestedFix": "Two changes needed: (1) DropOnLeafOperation.detectOperation should return null if setTreeDataPath is not provided, with a clear console warning. (2) The \"inside\" drop indicator should not show if setTreeDataPath is missing, to give proper UX feedback. Additionally, consider whether empty folders should be modeled as groups (type=\"group\" with children=[]) rather than leafs when treeData is enabled.",
